# 🏙️ City Discount Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks whether a user is eligible for a city-based discount. If the user enters a city that's on the list, they qualify!

---

## 📜 How It Works

- The program checks if the user’s input matches one of the cities in the predefined list.
- If it matches, they get a discount message.
- Otherwise, it notifies them they’re not eligible.

## 🧪 Example

Please enter the name of your city: Miami
Yes, Miami is in our list of cities, so you get a discount!
